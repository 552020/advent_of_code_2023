# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1

Solved in C.

No ChatGPT and no Co-pilot for coding, but for debugging: since I couldn't get the bug I got in the second part I let ChatGPT write a fast solution (which was wrong) in Python and then I let it write another small script to compare the outputs of the my C program and ChatGPT solution, to spot the lines, where my program failed.

My logic was not adressign the fact that a number (as a string) could occure multiple times in the input string.

## Day 2

Solved in Python.

But I did a first (and a second) unsuccesful try in C.

No Copilot. ChatGPT has been used to partially to spare on the first answer (and to explore the Python realm that I didn't touch since years and never appropriately). I managed the second one old-school, with Stack Overflow and the Internet.
