# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1

Solved in C.

Some ChatGPT for debugging: since I couldn't get the bug of my second part I let the model write a fast solution (which was wrong) in Python to compare the outputs and find the cases where my program was not working fine.

## Day 2

Solved in Python.

But I did a first (and a second) unsuccesful try in C.

The model has been used partially to generally spare on the first answer and to explore the Python realm, pretty new for me.

## Day03

(Partially) solved in Python. 

I didn't manage to get the second part right. I'll come back maybe later.

## Day04

(Partially) solved in Python.

00.24 - Starting now. Let's see how it goes.
02.03 - It took more than 1 hour to solve the first one. The second part already lets me cry.
05.00 - I give up!

## Day05

(Not solved) in Python. 

Only the test case was correctly computed. For the real first case the program was way too slow. 

18.41 - Start.
18.55 - I just read the assigment, without fully understand it.
20.19 - We start again.
21.28 - Pause.
22.50 - We start again.
23.59 - 1.10 hr to partially solve the problem of tabs and spaces in Python. The objective was to let the auto-formatter to convert tabs in spaces. I didn't reach the goal. But VSCode has an embedded functionality tranform spaces in tabs. Basically yak-shaving.
01.03 - I guess I have some working code but execution is taking very long because of loops on really big ranges.
01.46 - I had the brilliant idea to test the code with the small test file and the code throw some errors: I could solve them and I managed to get the final result, which is wrong of course!
02.41 - Debugging with prints, a lot of them. 
03.24 - "Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number. So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10." Remember to read the subject in depth!
04.08 - I found another bug. Hopefully the last one.
04.17 - Test input solved. 
04.22 - Execution started 
04.52 - The program has not finished execution yet. Good night!

## Day 06

03.45 - Start
