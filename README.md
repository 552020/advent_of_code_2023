# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1

Solved in C.

Some ChatGPT for debugging: since I couldn't get the bug of my second part I let the model write a fast solution (which was wrong) in Python to compare the outputs and find the cases where my program was not working fine.

## Day 2

Solved in Python.

But I did a first (and a second) unsuccesful try in C.

The model has been used partially to generally spare on the first answer and to explore the Python realm, pretty new for me. 

## Day03

(Partially) solved in Python. 

I didn't manage to get the second part right. I'll come back maybe later.

## Day04

00.24 - Starting now. Let's see how it goes.
